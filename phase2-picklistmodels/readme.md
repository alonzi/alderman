# notes on liaison review

* I have gone through my lists and made notations as appropriate. I am pretty happy with the PG class, but less so with the HQs. There are a lot of general, modern works that make sense in a browsing collection that didn’t get caught by the algorithm. I marked these with a “1,” it’s only a few dozen and I’ve been selective.
